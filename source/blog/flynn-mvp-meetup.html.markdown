date: October 24, 2013

Hello from the Flynn Team!

We've been hard at work for the past few months and things are moving along very
well.

Everything is on schedule and we expect to have an MVP of the major components
ready in early November. We will post more details about the MVP and the roadmap
forward as that date approaches.

The entire Flynn team will be in the Bay Area in early November to meet with
potential users and sponsors for 2014. We will also be hosting a Flynn meetup at
the Twilio offices at 8pm on November 5th. We'll demo what we have so far, talk
about what's coming, and answer any questions you have. [Please
RSVP](https://www.eventbrite.com/event/8979679463) so we can plan an appropriate
volume of refreshments and seating capacity.

We hope to see many of you in a few weeks and speak with the rest of you online
after the MVP launch. If you have any questions in the meantime or would like to
schedule a meeting with the team while we're in SF, drop us an email. Our time
is limited but we'd love to meet as many of you as possible.

â€”The Flynn Team (Jeff, Jonathan, and Daniel)
