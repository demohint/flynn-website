title: Flynn Meetups in London and Dortmund
date: March 7, 2014
---

The Flynn team is in Europe this week and will be holding meetups in London,
England and Dortmund, Germany. Thanks to a few community members we were able to
set up last minute events. We'll demo Flynn, talk about the project, and discus
the best ways to get started using and contributing to Flynn.

We'd love to see you there! Anyone who would like to meet with us privately in
London should also email daniel@flynn.io.
